        <section class="title">Problems</section>
        <section>A multitude of problems cause huge barriers for reducing STI cases, like the negative 
            stigmas surrounding seeking STI care, and the overly time-consuming process of healthcare 
            providers collecting data from sources like focus groups & sending it to local and national 
            levels. In addition, the majority of STI cases are reported among the youth age group. Below is our flow map 
            of factors to rising STIs. </section>
